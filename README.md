# Pneumonia Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model classifies images as either pneumonia-positive or normal.

## Dataset
We use the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset**, which is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled X-ray images categorized into `Pneumonia` and `Normal` classes.
